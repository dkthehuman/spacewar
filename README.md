## Background

In the spring of 2015, I took a class at Princeton called Great Moments of Computing in which we studied pivotal developments in computing by reading seminal papers and patents.

One of the moments we discussed in the class was the development of [Spacewar!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_%28video_game%29), one of the earliest computer games that was developed in 1962. Computer games as a whole have led to many advancements in computer science, including graphics and HCI, and Spacewar was a precursor to the explosion of games we see today.

For my final project, I used the [version playable on the PDP-1 emulator](http://spacewar.oversigma.com/html5/) as a model to port the game to the iPhone.
